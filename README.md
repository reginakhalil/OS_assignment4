When a request does not leave the system in a safe state, it is denied by the banker. 
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
For development, you will need a linux operating system. If you do not have the linux OS, you can install VirtualBox and Ubuntu on your device. You will also need a text editor of your choice (Notepad++ recommended for Windows users and SublimeText recommended for Mac users), and Git.
